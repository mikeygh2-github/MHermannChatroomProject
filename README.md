Mike Hermann's Chatroom Project

This is a simple chatroom project created with Node.JS 
	and Microsoft Visual Studio. 

This project uses the socket.io library to make connections to
	the application to send messages to all other users. I
	only currently have it running for localhost:3000


How-To Install using Microsoft Visual Studio:
	-Download the .zip file from my GitHub. 
	-Extract the contents to a directory. 
	-Open Microsoft Visual Studio and go to 'File'->'Open'->'Folder'
	-Navigate to the MHermannChatroomProject you extracted. 
	-Open the app.js file in the Solution Explorer window.  
	-Press the Run Current Document
	-Navigate to "localhost:3000" in a web browser. 

Functionalities: 
	-You can type messages to other users in this chatroom. 
		Since it only runs on a local machine, you can just open
		multiple tabs to show this functionality. 
	-When another user is typing, on other user's displays,
		it will show a message telling you who is typing. 
	-You can click on the 'Options Menu' button to open up a 
		pop-up that will show you user options to customize the page.
	-You can change your username in the Options Menu. 
	-You can change the color of your messages in the Options Menu.
